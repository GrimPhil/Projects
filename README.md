# Projects
Just a random repo for my learning-scoped projects

For this repo I want to store all kinds of projects I am making, with the end result I got satisfied with.

If anyone encounters this repo by accident and wants to give me some advice, feel free to do so, but respect my decision in the programming languages I have littered around.
I am open for criticism and if anyone wants to help me learn I would be extremely thankful.

All this is meant only for my own learning purposes, and no one else's, so if you want to use anything of what I have here, I will not take any responsibility for anything that might happen.
